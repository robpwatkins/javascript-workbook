// code plan for checkpoint 2: dodgeball

// 1. Use the class keyword to create a template of a dodgeBallPlayer that requires canThrowBall, canDodgeBall, hasPaid, isHealthy, yearsExperience

      - Need to use a class constructor function to add above five keys to person object
      - person needs to take on the class of a players
      - either define the values of those keys in the function or above in the people object

// 2. Push these new dodge ball Player objects into a new array and then display them in the DOM as available players to pick.
      - use makePlayer() function to 
            - assign person object a class of Player
            - push that new object (with its five new keys and values) to player array
            - use that array to manipulate the DOM to show the new players as people objects are passed through makePlayer function

// 3. Add a button to each new player that will allow each one to be selected for either Blue Team or Read Team and now has mascot and teamColor
      - also in makePlayer function
            - create html element of a button
            - add an eventlistener to that button which will run a function to
                  - pass that player through a BlueTeam or RedTeam class constructor
                  - push that new object to an array of blueTeam or redTeam

// 4. Display the two teams in a new list in the DOM with appropriate titles.
      - use blue (or red)Teammate function to
            - as stated above add class of Blue or RedTeam
            - push those into new array
            - create element in the DOM to display items of that array

// 5. Figure out how to remove them from the DOM when clicked!!!!!!!

// 6. Build 3 tests
